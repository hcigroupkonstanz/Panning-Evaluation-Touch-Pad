# Panning Evaluation Touch Pad

This tool was developed at the Human-Computer Interaction group at the University of Konstanz to evaluating different input devices ("Touch", "Pad" & "Move"). In this version only the "Touch" and "Pad" conditions are implemented. We recommended to use the software at a resolution of 1920 x 1080.
