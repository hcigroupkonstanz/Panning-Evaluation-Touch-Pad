# Spatial Memory - Navigation Task and Object Location Memory Task

This tool was developed by the [Human-Computer Interaction Group](http://hci.uni-konstanz.de) at the [University of Konstanz](https//www.uni-konstanz.de). 
We used this research prototype to investigate the influence of different state-of-the-art input modalities on spatial memory performance and object location memory. Our prototype consists of two tasks: (1) a navigation task, where participants have to navigate to spatially spread symbols and (2) an object location memory task, where participants have to recall the positions of the symbols.

Feel free to read our [paper](http://hci.uni-konstanz.de/downloads/pn4457-zagermannA.pdf) and watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feDyUiwuB_M) for further information.

We recommend to use the prototype at a resolution of 1920 x 1080.

Further documentation will be provided soon.
